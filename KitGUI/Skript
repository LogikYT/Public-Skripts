 #You can have up to 9 slots of ranks in the chest gui. If you want to add more rows, change "open chest with 1 row" to 2 instead of 1.
 
 #To change which kit they recieve, change "/kit Rank6" to "/kit (kitname)". To change the name of the item in the gui, change the "Rank6",
 #or whatever one your doing, to "(rankname)"
